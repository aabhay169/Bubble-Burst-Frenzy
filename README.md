Bubble Burst Frenzy is a image processing based game developed on python plateform for recreational activities. As with time interest of everyone in digital life is increasing it is becoming hard for them to get physical exercise. This game is a mixture of digital life and physical activities. This game uses image processing to detect a specific colour. Bubbles are projected on the wall and a camera is set to detect the activities on the wall.
